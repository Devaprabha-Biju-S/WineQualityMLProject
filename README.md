# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction

This project predicts the quality of wine using various physicochemical attributes. It leverages machine learning techniques to analyze red and white wine datasets and classify wine quality.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `WineQualityPrediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- `red_wine.csv`: Dataset containing physicochemical properties of red wine.
- `white_wine.csv`: Dataset containing physicochemical properties of white wine.

## 📊 Dataset

The datasets are from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:
- Red wine: 1599 samples
- White wine: 4898 samples
- Features include: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, and quality.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 ML Techniques Applied

- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Train/test split
- Classification models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, etc.
- Model evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

## 🎯 Objective

To build a classification model that accurately predicts the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties and helps in understanding which features contribute most to the wine quality.
